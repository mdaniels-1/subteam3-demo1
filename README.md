# subteam3-demo1

# backend.js (depricated, left for future reference)

NodeJS program that hosts a local server to handle requests, reads from Mongo database and uses template.ejs to render a website. Replaced with T1's superior server.js. Currently used only for local testing

# mongo-connect.js (testing)

NodeJS program that connects to hosted Mongo database. Only used for connecting to db on local end.

# template.ejs (depricated, but left here future reference)

Dummy party listing page just to show how the sharing functionality may work. Currently the URL doesn't not return to the test page since URL is formatted for the hosted website rather than local. Only used for local testing; replaced by T1's design

# twitterButton.html and facebookButton.html

2 files used to create HTML elements to work with T1's party_listings page. Does not work standalone. Include in .\PartySafari-T1\assets\js to test functionality

# partyDetail.html

HTML file that displays the party details of a party listing. Majority of the code belongs to T1; a small comment has been made at the appended location to show where changes have been made for shareToSocial functionality
